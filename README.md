# Snake
Simple snake game with a neural network on it


There is a bug with human controlled mode, as in I just didn't code it so there is no way to actually play. 

The neural network has a hard time scoring any points, ie the fruit is too spread out. So even if it scores on one run, that same brain will likely not score on the next run. I haven't spent a long time training this, as I suspect it would eventually get enough fruit to figure out how to get to them, I think some tweaking would have to happen if I wanted it to get close to a perfect snake game.
